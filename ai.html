      <h2>General Overview of Artificial Intelligence</h2>
      <p>The term Artificial Intelligence was coined by
        John McCarthy for the Dartmouth Summer Research
        Project on Artificial Intelligence in 1956. However,
        for centuries before there been contributions from
        the likes of Alan Turing. </br></br>

        Artificial Intelligence is the theory and development
        of systems that perform tasks that would normally
        be associated with human qualities. This includes
        visual perception, language translation, decision making
        and natural language processing. In Computer Science
        Artificial intelligence is often defined as the study
        of “intelligent agents”: any device that using its perception
        of the environment and takes actions to maximize the probability
        of successfully achieving certain ambitions. It is a research field
        that has applications to society and aims to solve real-world problems.
        It is the umbrella term for many smaller research fields including
        Computer Vision (Yiming’s particular field of research).</br></br>

        Artificial Intelligence research is a field that has applications
        to society and aims to solve real-world problems. It lends itself
        to situations where there is not repetitive labour, i.e. there needs
        to be intelligent decisions made on situations that unfamiliar to the
        system. Much like a human would when presented with new information.
        It has famously been applied to chess-like games, recently defeating
        not only chess grandmasters but also rule-based evaluation algorithms.
        Artificial Intelligence research has expanded across a plethora of
        academic disciplines in the search for true synthetic intelligence.
        As well as in academia, artificial intelligence has aided the progress
        of almost every part of today’s society.
